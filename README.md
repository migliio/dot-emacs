# emacs.d
This is emacs.d configuration. I use Emacs for basically everything (even if, since [2021-09-28], I use [https://logseq.com/](Logseq). For taking notes I use org-mode, for coding stuff I use LSP-mode. I use it also as an e-mail client with notmuch (on [2021-09-30] I started to think about learning and using mutt instead, but this is still in progress).
