# emacs.d

## Intro and motivation

This is emacs.d configuration. I use Emacs for basically everything. For taking notes I use org-mode, for coding stuff I use LSP-mode. I used to exploit it also as an e-mail client with notmuch (on [2021-09-30] I started to think about learning and using mutt instead, but I realized that it doesn't fit for my needs - on [2021-10-04] I decided to go back and use web-based e-mail client since I find useless and memory-consuming to have all my e-mails stored locally).
However, Emacs is love and hate: it has problems (everything does) but it gives me a huge flexibility and freedom to choose whatever workflow fits my needs the most.
