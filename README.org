* Dot-emacs

** Intro and motivation
This is emacs.d configuration. I use Emacs for basically everything. For taking notes I use org-mode, for coding stuff I use LSP-mode. I use ~mu4e~ to manage e-mails and ~elfeed~ to read RSS feeds. I started using Emacs around [2020-04-30 Thu] and I proceeded in tweaking and using it since then.
