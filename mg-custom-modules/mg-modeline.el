;;; Commentary:
;; This source file defines a custom modeline for the Emacs editor. It
;; has a cleaner structure compared to the original one, and
;; highlights buffer state (i.e., local vs. remote, saved vs. unsaved)
;; more clearly.

;;; Code:

	(propertize " ^ "
		    'mouse-face 'mode-line-highlight)))
  "This is the propertized variable containing the status of the
current buffer. The status specifies whether this buffer is
remote or local.")

(defvar mg-modeline-buffer-name
    '(:eval
      (propertize (buffer-name) 'face 'mode-line-buffer-id))
    "This is the propertized variable containing the current buffer's
name.")

(defun mg-modeline--major-mode ()
  "This is a function used to get the current major mode for the
opened buffer. The major mode is obtained by looking at the
`major-mode' variable. In case we are under EXWM, the major mode
haas also a `exwm--input-mode' further specification (i.e., Char
or Line) that is also useful to specify in the modeline."
